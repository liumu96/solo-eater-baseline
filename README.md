## Data

- Participant ID
- The video they watch
- Video-watching duration <open, close, when stop, when resume>
- Meal duration
- Resume chewing duration:
  - When the system detects a participant watching without chewing for a specified duration (e.g, xx seconds), it will measure the time it takes for them to resume chewing.
  - We hypothesize that with our system, participants will resume eating faster compared to their normal video-watching routine. If participants can join a Zoom call simultaneously, it would be beneficial. This allows us to record their reactions when they see the designed features.
